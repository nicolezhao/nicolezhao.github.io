                    <p> In November 2015, I was chosen amongst 7 youth delegates to represent Canada at the APEC CEO’s and Leaders’ Summit in Manila. Our main objective was to gain traction for inbound FDI on behalf of Global Affairs Canada and Parks Canada. During the summit, we participated in the Voices of the Future program hosted at the Asia Development Bank. Working alongside youth from 21 member economies, we drafted a youth declaration for the APEC Business Advisory Council on the role youth play in shaping a more sustainable economy.</p>

                    <p>
                    I also had the chance to meet with Prime Minister Trudeau, who is also by coincidence the Minister of Youth, at the summit about what it takes to be the next generation of leaders. After 7 days, my team and I brought back deliverables through analyzing targets, pitching to CEOs, obtaining key contacts, and conducting market research.

                    <p> As team lead of the education sector, I conducted meetings with leaders of the Ministry of Education and organized information sessions for Chinese high school students to learn more about studying abroad through real student-to-student conversations.  </p>
